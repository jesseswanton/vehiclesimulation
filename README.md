# Vehicle Stats and Abilities Simulation

## Overview

This is a TypeScript command-line application that logs details and simulates use of cars, trucks, and motorbikes.

The application prompts the user to create a new vehicle or select an existing vehicle.

After going through the creation process or the selection process, the user is able to perform certain actions with the selected vehicle such as starting the vehicle, accelarating, turning or stopping.

Trucks have the added ability of towing other vehicles.

Motorbikes have the added ability of doing a wheelie!

The user is returned to the actions menu after each action until they decide to exit the application.
